Carilec 2015 IT/OT Conference
------------------------------------------------------------
Abusing GitHub as a place to store some presentations, scripts, etc. 
Carilec October 22nd and 23rd, St. Lucia. 
------------------------------------------------------------

These presentations are what I consider "Public Domain" and "EgoWare". 
EgoWare = If you like it, let me know. If you don't... don't.
